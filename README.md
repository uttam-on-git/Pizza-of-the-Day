## üöÄ How To Run Locally

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running for development.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later is recommended)
* NPM or another package manager

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/uttam-on-git/Pizza-of-the-Day
    cd Pizza-of-the-Day
    ```

2.  **Install project dependencies:**
    This command will install packages for both the backend and the React frontend.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Prepare the database:**
    The server is configured to use a file named `pizza.sqlite` in the root directory. You may need to have a pre-existing database file with the correct schema for the application to function correctly.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    This will launch the Fastify API server.
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    Open a new terminal and run the following command to start the React app.
    ```bash
    # (Assuming a standard React setup like Vite)
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application frontend will be accessible in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.
